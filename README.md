# 🧩 aux — ClassicAPI

A performance-focused fork of **aux** for **World of Warcraft 1.12.1 / Turtle WoW**.

Focused on **stability, compatibility and lower runtime overhead** while keeping the original aux Auction House workflow intact.

> Despite the repository name, aux currently has **no hard ClassicAPI dependency**. `ShaguTweaks` remains optional and is only used as a vendor-value fallback when available.

## 🔌 Requirements

- **World of Warcraft 1.12.1 / Turtle WoW**
- Do not load another copy of aux at the same time
- **ShaguTweaks** — optional

## 📦 Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Rename the folder to `aux-AddOn` if needed.
3. Copy it to:

```text
World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\aux-AddOn
```

4. Restart the game.

## ✨ Main changes

This fork keeps aux's original behaviour and focuses on targeted low-risk improvements:

- Bounded WDB item-cache scanning to avoid large synchronous warm-cache bursts.
- Merchant bag-value refresh changed from permanent polling to one-shot deferred updates.
- Reduced listener and scheduler bookkeeping overhead.
- Daily Auction House minimum cache to avoid repeated SavedVariables parsing.
- Reduced allocations in historical-value calculations.
- Search, Auctions and Bids validation throttled to **10 Hz** instead of every frame.
- Post-tab heavy UI work only runs when something actually changes.
- Autopricing reuses historical, vendor-charge and disenchant calculations.
- Reduced tooltip scans and temporary table creation.
- Auction-listing rendering stops once all visible rows are filled.
- Selection lookup returns immediately once the selected auction is found.
- LFT price-sharing handler rejects unrelated traffic earlier and reuses cached daily minimums.
- Disenchant tooltip calculations are skipped when both disenchant tooltip options are disabled.

The Auction House request throttle and embedded **ChatThrottleLib** are intentionally left unchanged where server-side limits or compatibility make modification unsafe.

## 📊 Price History

aux stores market information using two separate values:

- **Today** — the lowest unit buyout known for the current day
- **Value** — the long-term historical reference calculated from daily values

The daily minimum can come from your own Auction House scans or from compatible `AuxData` messages received through **LFT** when sharing is enabled.

At daily rollover, the minimum becomes a historical data point. aux keeps up to **11 daily values** and calculates an **age-weighted median** to keep the result stable without allowing repeated same-day scans to dominate the history.

Enable both tooltip values with:

```text
/aux tooltip value
/aux tooltip daily
```

## 🔗 LFT Price Sharing

Price sharing is enabled by default.

Toggle it with:

```text
/aux sharing
```

Messages use the format:

```text
AuxData,<item_key>,<unit_buyout_price>
```

Only a lower daily minimum is stored. Searches of **15 pages or more are not broadcast** to reduce LFT channel traffic.

## 🎨 Themes

aux includes two interface styles:

- **Blizzard** — default Blizzard-like theme
- **Modern** — original-style modern theme

Switch with:

```text
/aux theme
```

## 🔎 Search Filters

Queries are separated by `;`, while individual filter parts use `/`.

Examples:

```text
felcloth/exact/stack/5
recipe/usable/not/libram
armor/cloth/50/intellect/stamina
```

The built-in **Filter Builder** can be used as a visual tutorial for more advanced filters and logical operators.

## ⚙️ Compatibility

- World of Warcraft 1.12.1
- Turtle WoW-style Auction House behaviour
- Turtle WoW custom-item cache / autocompletion support
- Optional ShaguTweaks vendor-value fallback
- Existing aux SavedVariables format preserved
- Existing LFT `AuxData` message format preserved

## ⚠️ Notes

- Auction House page-request speed is limited by the server. aux cannot safely bypass that limit.
- `Today` is the **lowest price seen today**, not simply the most recently scanned listing.
- Turtle WoW deposit costs can differ from the locally displayed estimate.
- ChatThrottleLib is kept intact for safe chat-rate handling.
